for each of the entity, because we need to de-normalize the row for faster look-up, we not only save the referenced table’s id, but also the its name. For example, we save city-id and city-name in the user’s table. Therefore, the convention of naming in the Java class is: getCity() -> return city’s name, and getCityId -> return city’s id. I’ve seen many places that we think that getCity() -> returns cityId, thus giving bugs in these places	In addition, CQL already automatically convert these into the appropriate types (i.e cityId -> int, city -> String) so we just have to call the correct method and don’t need any extra-conversions for calls to get data from DB. If you need to check whether a probably is in the object, for example, whether “cityId” is in the User’s object (u), call u.hasProperty(User.FIELD_CITY_ID)...
